issue #1929 this is a header

1.The previous alignment of Doris is up to 8 bytes.

2.For types with more than 8 bytes, such as Date, Datetime is not aligned.

3.This PR is mainly to relax the maximum 8-byte limitation

4.Also, because the data type Decimal v1 no longer exists,

5.the logic of the 40-byte Decimal v1 is also discarded.
